There are certain models within a framework that are essentially equivalent. For example if <span>$D_1$</span> and <span>$D_2$</span> are sets with homomorphism <span>$g:D_2\mapsto D_1$</span>, then <span>$M_1 = (D_1, R, f) = (D_2, R, f \odot g)$</span> are equivalent as models. In fact <span>$(D_2, D_1, g)$</span> should be included in the class of models in a modeling framework.</p><p>We need a good theoretical foundation for proving theorems about manipulating models and combining them. Categories for Science may be that foundation.</p><p>The work of Evan Patterson on building semantic representations of data science programs is particularly relevant to these modeling questions <a href="https://www.epatters.org/assets/papers/2018-semantic-enrichment-ijcai-demo.pdf &quot;Semantic Representations of Data Science Programs&quot;">SRDSP</a>. <a href="https://www.epatters.org/assets/papers/2018-semantic-enrichment-kdd.pdf &quot;Teaching machines to understand data science code by semantic enrichment of dataflow graphs&quot;">Patterson 2018</a> </p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Categories-for-Science-1" href="#Categories-for-Science-1">Categories for Science</a></h2><p>Dan Spivak wrote a wonderful book on category theory for scientists based on his lectures at MIT http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/CT4S.pdf.</p><blockquote><p>Data gathering is ubiquitous in science. Giant databases are currently being mined for unknown patterns, but in fact there are many (many) known patterns that simply have not been catalogued. Consider the well-known case of medical records. A patient’s medical history is often known by various individual doctor-offices but quite inadequately shared between them. Sharing medical records often means faxing a hand-written note or a filled-in house-created form between offices.</p><p>Similarly, in science there exists substantial expertise making brilliant connections between concepts, but it is being conveyed in silos of English prose known as journal articles. Every scientific journal article has a methods section, but it is almost impossible to read a methods section and subsequently repeat the experiment—the English language is inadequate to precisely and concisely convey what is being done</p></blockquote><p>This is the point of our project, to mine the code and docs for the information necessary to repeat and <em>expand</em> scientific knowledge. Reproducible research is focused on getting the code/data to be shared and runnable with VMs/Docker etc are doing the first step. Can I repeat your analysis? We want to push that to expanding.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Ologs-1" href="#Ologs-1">Ologs</a></h3><p>Ontology logs are a diagrammatic approach to formalizing scientific methodologies.
