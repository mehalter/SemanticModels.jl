Stochastic SEIRD model The model is SEIRD model, where infected individuals can survive or die at different rates, with waning immunity. The full model specification is: S susceptibles E exposed, i.e. infected but not yet contagious I_r infectious who will survive I_d infectious who will die R recovered D dead There are no birth of natural death processes in this model. Parameters are: Beta rate of infection Delta rate at which symptoms appear (i.e inverse of mean incubation period) Gamma_r recovery rate Gamma_d death rate Mu case fatality ratio (proportion of cases who die) Epsilon import rate of infected individuals (applies to E and I Omega rate waning immunity The model will be written as:
