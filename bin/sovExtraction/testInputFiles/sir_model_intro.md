## SIR model

*Author*: Simon Frost

*Date*: 2018-07-12

### Description

The susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model in a closed population was proposed by Kermack and McKendrick as a special case of a more general model, and forms the framework of many compartmental models. Susceptible individuals, $S$, are infected by infected individuals, $I$, at a per-capita rate $\beta I$, and infected individuals recover at a per-capita rate $\gamma$ to become recovered individuals, $R$.

### Equations

$$
\frac{dS(t)}{dt}  = -\beta S(t) I(t)\\
\frac{dI(t)}{dt}  = \beta S(t) I(t)- \gamma I(t)\\
\frac{dR(t)}{dt}  = \gamma I(t)
$$
